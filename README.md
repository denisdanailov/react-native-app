## Install and run

Note: Spring Boot Server App must be running before starting the client!

When the server is running you can try to access the API for example to query all offers
```
url http://localhost:8080/api/offers/all
```
After starting the server you can install and run the client from the `client` folder:

1. `npm install` (installs the node modules)
2. `npm start`
